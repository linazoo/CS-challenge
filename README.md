# CS Coding Challenge

## First test

Scope: CSS and Markup only

Problem Statement: Create this stepped progress indicator to be fluid/responsive. Donâ€™t forget accessibility!

Brownie points: Adding some interaction like a pervious/next state to move between steps.


## Second test

Scope: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Problem Statement: Create a progress bar widget as shown in the video.

Brownie Points: Unit tests and responsive behavior

Timebox myself for each tests focusing on the most important features
